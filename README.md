likes python and javascript
websockets are neat

That is my best attempt at a haiku.  
I'm a fullstack web dev, mainly with Python on the backend. Most of my experience has been with Flask, but because of my WebSocket addiction, I'm trying to switch to Tornado. The only reason I use TypeScript is for autocompletion. I want to learn Rust or Java, but I haven't really gotten to it. I also don't use Git very much. That's Flask's fault though.
